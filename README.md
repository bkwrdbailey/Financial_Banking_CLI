# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This project was made to help people learn about investments and the amount of interest they can gain yearly based on a specific initial investment, monthly deposit amount, and the percent of interest being taken. In addition, the user is also shown how their interest will change if no monthly deposit is being given, so they can better compare and contrast differing values.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe my interface for the user was well done, so that no value seemed confusing and could not be misinterpreted as something else. Also, I did well at creating the program with uncluttered code and comments placed throughout it to help another programmer understand what each function or loop does.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One thing that would be a major enhancement for my code would be to make sure to clean any memory allocation at the end of the program as to avoid memory access errors. This code does not have any of that implemented and even does not have a delete for the class. Implementing this fix in the code will make it more secure due to the avoidance of memory access issues that would lead to memory leaks, which are some causes of video games to slow down and ultimately crash.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The main challenge I had come across when writing this code was the implementation of loops that would keep going until a valid value was entered. When testing the code, it would infinitely loop if a different data type than what the input variable could hold was given. Therefore, I had to use valid check loops and a try catch to make sure that the code would not infinitely loop and the user was notified of why their value entered was not valid. This led to the addition of tutorialspoint as a resource that was helpful in making me understand how to properly create code that can check for valid inputs.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
One skill from this project that can be used in others is the ability to output data to the user in a clean and articulate way, so that no questions are asked over what each value is supposed to represent. Another transferable skill would be writing clean/readable code as that will be beneficial for a site like this where I am able to have contributors help add to the code and if they can easily read and understand my code then they would be able to make additions that would not impact the overall program.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This code is maintainable due to the comments I placed through out it so that each block of code can be updated accordingly. In addition, this code is readable due to the proper amount of spacing between code so to avoid any clutter and confusion for what is being declared or what task is being implemented in each block of code. Finally, the code is adaptable as it only uses c++ code and no c code which would be less likely to adapt to any new libraries or IDE's that my come out in the future.
